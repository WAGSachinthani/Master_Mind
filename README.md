# Guessing Game 🎲

A simple guessing game implemented in Python. 🐍

## Description ℹ️

This Python script implements a basic guessing game where the player has to guess a secret four-digit code within a limited number of attempts. The code generates a random four-digit code, and the player receives feedback after each guess indicating the correctness of their numbers. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the entire code or exhausts all attempts. 🔢

## Features ✨

- Generates a random four-digit code for the player to guess.
- Provides feedback on each guess, indicating the correctness of the numbers guessed.
- Limits the number of attempts allowed for the player to guess the code.
- Ends the game when the player correctly guesses the entire code or exhausts all attempts.
